"The Chariot: A Study in Directed Will

The Chariot speaks to the convergence of intention and action. This is not impulsive movement—it is purposeful momentum. Consider it the difference between scattered effort and focused trajectory.

The Three-Phase Framework:
1. Clarity: Define the destination with precision
2. Commitment: Align your resources toward that endpoint  
3. Course Correction: Adjust as needed without losing direction

The card invites you to examine: What would it look like to move forward with both confidence and flexibility?

Reflection: The Chariot doesn't promise an easy path. It promises that the path exists—and that you have what you need to walk it."

affirmation: "I trust my direction. I adjust my approach without losing my way."
